# Project Yeh Chan Lin - Personal Page

## 📅 Summary: February 25, 2026

Today, I developed a premium single-page personal website for **Yeh Chan Lin**. The project focuses on a modern, high-end aesthetic with real-time dynamic elements.

### 🚀 Work Completed
- **Established Design System**: Created a dark-themed UI using a curated color palette (Slate & Sky Blue) and premium Google Fonts (*Playfair Display* and *Outfit*).
- **Glassmorphism Interface**: Implemented a centered "glass" container with backdrop-blur and subtle borders for a sophisticated look.
- **Dynamic Real-Time Clock**: Developed a JavaScript-based clock that displays the current time and date, updating every second.
- **Micro-animations**: Added a smooth reveal animation on page load and a pulsing "Live Status" indicator.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensured the design looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and SEO-friendly metadata.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties, Flexbox alignment, and glassmorphism styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: DOM manipulation for the clock and entry animations.

### 📂 File Structure
- `index.html`: Main page structure.
- `style.css`: Design tokens and layout styles.
- `script.js`: Interactive clock and animation logic.
- `image.png`: Visual preview of the design.
